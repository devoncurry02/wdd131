            <h2>Mosiah 24:14</h2>
            <p>And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</p>

            <h2>1 Thessalonians 5:16-23</h2>
            <p>16 Rejoice evermore.
                17 Pray without ceasing.
                18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
                19 Quench not the Spirit.
                20 Despise not prophesyings.
                21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
                22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.
                23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
